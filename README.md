 **Coffee Sales Analysis (MySQL)**

 **Overview:**

This project is based on a coffee sales dataset that includes product details like coffee name, unit price, timing, payment method and the date of each transaction.

**Tools Used:**

  The entire analysis was performed in MySQL, including data cleaning, transformation,    and generating insights.

**Data Cleaning Performed:**

  * Removed duplicate rows from the dataset.

  * Converted the date column from text (VARCHAR) to a proper DATE format.

  * Standardized inconsistent text values in the coffee_name column.

**Analysis Completed:**

  * Calculated total sales by coffee type, size, and month.

  * Used SQL techniques such as GROUP BY, CTEs, and window functions including RANK and     DENSE_RANK.

  * Created stored procedures to automate repetitive queries and reports.

**Key Insights Identified:**

  * Latte was the highest-selling coffee throughout the dataset.

  * Sales were significantly higher during the month of march.

  * Total sales by coffee name and month

**SQL Concepts Practiced:**

Worked with  aggregation functions, grouping, CTEs, ranking functions, and stored procedures.

**Outcome:**

The final result is a clean and well-structured database ready for analysis, along with SQL scripts that can be reused for similar datasets.

**Future Enhancements:**

Plan to integrate the cleaned data into a visualization tool such as Power BI or Tableau to create dashboards and track trends visually.
